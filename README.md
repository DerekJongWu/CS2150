###Author: Derek Wu
This course focused on data structures and algorithms. Many of the assignments involved the implementation of data structures and consequently using those data structures to solve problems. 

## Lab1 
Lab 1 had two parts: getting familiar with .h files and .cpp files as well as a simple recursion excercise to gain familiarity with C++ coding language. 

## Lab2
Implementation of a linked list and accompanying methods using pointers. 

## Lab3 
Implementation of a stack and accompanying methods using pointers. 

## Lab4
To familiarize and become comfortable with binary and radix conversions, the lab focused on converting base 10 numbers into binary other radix versions. 

## Lab5
Implementation of a bianry search tree and an AVL tree. In addition, this lab introduced how to use a Makefile. 

## Lab6
Implementation of a hashtable using an array. This hashtable was then used for a word search problem. 

## Lab7 
To get familiar with machine code and how high-level language programs are represented at the machine level, the implementation of bubble sort using IBCM (Itsy Bitsy Computing Machine) a custom language built by the UVA professors. 

## Lab8
Using assembly language, solve various recursive math problems. 

## Lab9
Implement a recursive routine to determine if an input number is even or odd based on the three plus one conjecture. All code had to be assembly language. 

## Lab10
Implement a Huffman encoding tree and use it to become familiar with the compression and decompression of files.
